# Whole Lotta Random Files

this whole repo is just random files that i create and use that others may benefit from and likely use.

for example, to install Firefox/Floorp with powershell (intended to avoid opening the shitshow known as Edge)
`irm https://snippets.k3t.xyz/windows/scripts/floorp.ps1 | iex` (replace with firefox if wanted)

`dns/schoolhosts` is a dns blocklist you can use to prevent school based spyware (such as GoGuardian) from running on your home network, so that you can ensure your privacy is intact. (make sure to reboot before connecting to wifi again to make sure spyware cannot communicate with the hosts via a cached ip)
